Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:
- Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
- Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Example:
```
Input: "((()))"
Output: True

Input: "[()]{}"
Output: True

Input: "({[)]"
Output: False
```
